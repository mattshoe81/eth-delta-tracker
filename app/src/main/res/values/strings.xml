    <string name="mattsBio">Thank you for downloading our app! I am Matthew Shoemaker (as you may have gathered by this point).
        \n\nAs of the creation of this app (Summer 2017) I am enrolled as a student in The Ohio State University, majoring in Computer
        Science and Engineering, and I have just completed my Freshman Year!\n\nDuring the project, I was in charge of doing the
        coding and UI manipulation for the app! This is the very first app that I have ever created, so thank you for giving it a try!
        \n\nWe are under no pretenses that this is a perfect app, so if you run into issues, please inform us and we will do absolutely
        everything in our power to correct the issue!</string>
    <string name="adamsBio">Coming Soon!</string>
